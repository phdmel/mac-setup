XCode
=====

Install [Xcode][1] from the [App store][2] or the Apple developer website.

[1]: <https://developer.apple.com/xcode/>

For installing Xcode command line tools run the command

~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
    xcode-select --install
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It'll prompt you to install the command line tools. Follow the instructions and
now you have Xcode and Xcode command line tools both installed and running.

This will trigger a software update dialog box. Click install and wait for it to
complete. If this does not work, [download the installation package from
Apple][3]. You will need an Apple developer account to do this.

Once Xcode is installed, start it up. The tools we need will not work unless the
app has run once, and you’ve accepted the licence agreement. You don’t need to
do anything with the app. Just start it up (It can take a while to run the first
time, even on a fast machine) click agree, and shut it down.
